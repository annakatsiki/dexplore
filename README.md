DExplore: an online tool for detecting differentially expressed genes from mRNA microarray experiments 
 
DExplore (www.dexplore.gr) is an online and easy-to-use web application for detecting differentially expressed genes using data from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the international public repository that archives and freely distributes high-throughput functional genomics data submitted by the research community. 

DExplore can also be used locally to analyze data even if not submitted to NCBIâ€™s GEO and allows privacy for users that have not yet submitted their data and wish to acquire a preliminary estimation of their experimental results. 

In addition, the application enables the user to proceed directly to functional enrichment analysis with the well-established online tool WebGestalt, using the results obtained from the preceding differential expression analysis of DExplore. 

DExplore is built using R programming language, shiny package and Bioconductor.
